## Notes

* debugger or byebug to set a breakpoint where the code stop
* step - goes deeper into the function on the current line if possible
* next - advances to the next line
* continue - let the execution continue until the natural end or a breakpoint
* byebug filename. - start the file in debug mode
* p - to print local variables you can run any ruby code actually
* display - to automatically have variables printed when code stops
* where - to show the call stack, also up and down
* b <linenumber> - to set a breakpoint so the code will always stop
